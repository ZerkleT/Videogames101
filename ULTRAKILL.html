    <p>Welcome to Ultrakill. A world where humans are extinct, god is dead, and machines are fueled off of blood. You play as V1, a wartime prototype built to kill. Without any organic life left on the surface, you and many other robots take the plunge deep into the depths of hell.</p>
    <p>But before you can start your killing spree, you need a weapon. After all, what is a Vampiric killer robot without their sci-fi arsenal of weapons?</p>
    <p>The first weapon you find is the revolver; specifically the piercer variant. But this isn't any ordinary revolver. It's a special kind of gun that fires microscopic shards of metal, with the cylinder of the gun holding the revolving batteries that shoot these shards.</p>
