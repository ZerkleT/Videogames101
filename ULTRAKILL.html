    <p>Welcome to Ultrakill. A world where humans are extinct, god is dead, and machines are fueled off of blood. You play as V1, a wartime prototype built to kill. Without any organic life left on the surface, you and many other robots take the plunge deep into the depths of hell.</p>
    <p>But before you can start your killing spree, you need a weapon. After all, what is a Vampiric killer robot without their sci-fi arsenal of weapons?</p>
    <p>The first weapon you find is the revolver; specifically the piercer variant. But this isn't any ordinary revolver. It's a special kind of gun that fires microscopic shards of metal, with the cylinder of the gun holding the revolving batteries that shoot these shards.</p>
    <p>While you can't do anything too fancy with this first weapon, it's still more than enough to tear your enemies a new <a href="V1'sArms.html">arm.</a></p>
    <p>This all happens in the first level of the game, "0-1", also known as "Into the fire". This level mostly serves as an introduction to this game's style. That being of nonstop action and insane combos. within this first level. you are introduced to your first weapons and three basic enemies.</p>

    <figcaption><p>The most basic of basic enemies, the filth can be killed with just about any attack. Not having any arms, the filth attacks with a bite, dealing a large chunk of damage.</p></figcaption>

    <p>While these enemies may seem threatening at first, they can very easily be dealt with using just about every weapon in V1's arsenal.</p>
    <p>For example, with the piercer revolver, a basic shot will instantly kill one of these enemies, but you could also use it's charge shot, as taught to you later in the level, to deal with multiple filth at once.</p>
